# Unit 4 Programming Project #

_**Goal:** Create a Python program using Unit 4 topics to demonstrate knowledge and mastery._

## Requirements:
- Tie it to a real-world topic:
  - Should be linked to an article, podcast, video, etc.
OR 
  - A personal idea for something that is useful/fun for you, your community, etc.
- Must use materials from, and restricted to, topics we've covered in this class. Specifically, 
  - Must include at least 1 programmer-defined class for each group member, in addition to the `Main` class.
    - each class definition must have **at least** 3 instance variables representing two or more datatypes (`string`, `int`, `float`, `boolean`).
    - each class definition must have **all** of our required methods for encapsulation:
      - default `__init__` method that initializes all variables to programmer-defined default values
      - full `__init__` method that initializes all variables to parameter values
      - accessor/getter and mutator/setter methods for each instance variable
      - `__str__` method
      - you may add any additional methods that are useful to your project, the above is just the minimum
  - Must have a driver (`main`) that illustrates the use of each programmer-defined class type.
  - Must use inheritance or a graphical user interface.
  - May also use topics from Units 1 & 2 & 3

## Resources: ##
Textbook and Lecture Videos for examples, Python syntax rules, and strategy

Replit repls or GitHub repositories for larger examples, getting inspiration or ideas.

Yes, you can build on your Unit 1, Unit 2, or Unit 3 Deliverable.

## Scoring Guide: ##
All group members might not recieve the same score. Be sure to indicate which parts of the project you contributed by inserting comments. You may also be asked to explain portions of the code so that I can distinguish your personal understanding of the material.

This assignment will be scored on the **EARN** scale, an **A** or **E** is needed for completion.

- **Exemplary (E)**: Everything for A plus code is well-documented and follows all course style conventions. This work could be used as a classroom example.

- **Acceptable (A)**: Understanding of the concepts is evident. Code compiles and runs without errors. All of the requirements are met.

- **Revision Needed (R)**: Partial understanding of the concepts is evident, but there are significant gaps. Further review and improvements required. Program does not run or not all requirements are met. See comments for suggested improvements.

- **Not Assessable (N)**: Not enough information is present in the work to determine whether there is understanding of the concepts.
